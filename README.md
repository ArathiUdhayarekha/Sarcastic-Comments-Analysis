# Sarcastic Comment Detection

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the DenseNet201 model for detecting sarcasm in comments. The provided dataset (`english_task_a (2).csv`) is used to train and evaluate the model.

## Project Structure

- `DataPreparation.py`: Contains code for cleaning and preparing the dataset for model training.
- `english_task_a (2).csv`: The dataset for sarcastic comment detection.
- `Interpretation.py`: Used for interpreting the model's results after training.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of required Python libraries for the project.
- `sarcastic_detection_notebook.ipynb.txt`: A Jupyter notebook file containing step-by-step training and evaluation of the model.
- `Sarcastic_Detection_Pipeline.py`: The full pipeline from data preparation to model training and testing.
- `Train_Model.py`: Code to train the DenseNet201 model.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sarcastic-comment-detection.git
cd sarcastic-comment-detection
2.set up environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3.Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
1. Data Preparation
The DataPreparation.py script prepares the input data for model training by cleaning and tokenizing it.

Run the following command to prepare the data:
python DataPreparation.py
2. Training the Model
The core training happens in Train_Model.py. This script trains the DenseNet201 model using the prepared dataset.

To start the training process:
python Train_Model.py
3. Model Interpretation
After training, the Interpretation.py script helps interpret the model's results and evaluate its performance.

Run the interpretation process:
python Interpretation.py
4. Running the Pipeline
Alternatively, you can run the entire process from data preparation to model training and evaluation using the pipeline script:
python Sarcastic_Detection_Pipeline.py
Jupyter Notebook
If you prefer a Jupyter Notebook, you can explore the full training process step-by-step in the sarcastic_detection_notebook.ipynb.txt. Rename the file to .ipynb and open it using:
jupyter notebook sarcastic_detection_notebook.ipynb
Dataset
The dataset (english_task_a (2).csv) contains comments and labels indicating whether each comment is sarcastic or not. The model is trained to predict this label based on the comment text.

Requirements
All the required Python libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file. To install them, simply run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Model Architecture
The model is built using DenseNet201, a pre-trained deep learning model, which is fine-tuned on the sarcastic comments dataset.
pandas==1.3.3
numpy==1.21.2
tensorflow==2.5.0
keras==2.5.0
scikit-learn==0.24.2
jupyter==1.0.0


Results
After training, the model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
